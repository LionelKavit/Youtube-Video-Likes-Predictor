# Youtube-Video-Likes-Predictor
This project uses a deep learning neural network to predict the likes-to-views ratio of a youtube video.

YouTube is one of the largest video-sharing platforms, where content creators rely on audience engagement metrics such as likes, views, and comments to measure their success. Deep learning can analyze large-scale YouTube metadata, video features, and historical engagement trends to build a predictive model that estimates the number of likes a video will receive. This can help creators optimize their content strategy, improve audience engagement, and increase monetization opportunities. This is also a useful tool for brands to analyze and strategically place their YouTube ads.
